Configuring WSPR receiver

By default, the uploads to wsprnet.org are disabled and all the decoded data are
accumulated in /dev/shm/ALL_WSPR.TXT.

To enable uploads, the CALL and GRID variables should be specified in
decode-wspr.sh. These variables should be set to the call sign of the receiving
station and its 6-character Maidenhead grid locator.

The frequency correction ppm value can be adjusted by editing the CORR variable
in decode-wspr.sh.

The bands can be configured by editing and recompiling write-c2-files.c.
The freq[8] array contains all the WSPR frequencies. They can be enabled or
disabled by uncommenting or by commenting the corresponding lines. The command
to compile write-c2-files.c from the Red Pitaya command line is:

  gcc write-c2-files.c -o write-c2-files -lm
