Configuring WSPR receiver

To enable uploads to wsprnet.org the CALL and GRID variables should be specified
in decode-wspr.sh.

The frequency correction ppm value can be adjusted by editing the CORR variable
in decode-wspr.sh.

The bands can be configured by editing and recompiling write-c2-files.c.
The freq[8] array contains all the WSPR frequencies. They can be enabled or
disabled by uncommenting or by commenting the corresponding lines.
The command to compile write-c2-files.c is:

  gcc write-c2-files.c -o write-c2-files -lm
